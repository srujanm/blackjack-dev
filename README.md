# blackjack-dev

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that were written during the development of the [blackjack](https://github.com/srujanm/blackjack) source code. They should allow you to get a quick idea of the structure of the code and can serve as a testing ground if you choose to modify it. The [Overall Design](https://github.com/srujanm/blackjack-dev/blob/master/Overall%20design.ipynb) notebook is a good place to start.

To download the notebooks, run

```
git clone https://github.com/srujanm/blackjack-dev.git
```

You need to install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to open the notebooks on your computer. It is included in the [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) distribution.
